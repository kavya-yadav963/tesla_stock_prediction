# Tesla Stock Prediction 🚗📈

This project explores how machine learning can be used to predict **Tesla’s stock prices**.  
Using a **Random Forest Regressor** along with technical indicators like RSI, MACD, moving averages, volatility, and lag features, the model forecasts short-term price movements and visualizes both historical performance and monthly predictions.
